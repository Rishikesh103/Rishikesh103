## ðŸš€ Featured Projects
-  [PackerUnpacker-.zip-ViceCity](https://github.com/Rishikesh103/PackerUnpacker-.zip-ViceCity) â€” Pack & unpack large directories into a single file  


-  [Shell-Customised_Virtual_File_System_CVFS](https://github.com/Rishikesh103/Shell-Customised_Virtual_File_System_CVFS) â€” A C++ simulation of an in-memory, inode-based virtual file system with an interactive command-line shell.


-  [Logic-Building Exercises](https://github.com/Rishikesh103/logic_building_assignments) â€” C problems for beginners  
-  [Study_Traker](https://github.com/Rishikesh103/Study_Traker) â€”  A comprehensive command-line application built with Java to help students and professionals log, track, and analyze their study sessions.


-  [ctOS_Compressor_and_Encryptor](https://github.com/Rishikesh103/ctOS_Compressor_and_Encryptor) â€”  A custom-built, multi-featured desktop application developed in Java for bundling, encrypting, and compressing large files and directories, all wrapped in a unique, "hacker-themed" graphical user interface inspired by Watch Dogs 2.


-  [Generalized_DataStructures_Toolkit.h](https://github.com/Rishikesh103/DataStructures_Toolkit) â€” A comprehensive, header-only, generic C++ library of fundamental data structures and algorithms. This toolkit is designed to be a reusable and easy-to-integrate solution for various programming needs.


-  [WIN32SDK-Generalized-C-Data-Structures-Toolkit-in-.dll-](https://github.com/Rishikesh103/WIN32SDK-Generalized-C-Data-Structures-Toolkit-in-.dll-) â€” A comprehensive, header-only C++ template library of fundamental data structures and algorithms, designed for maximum performance and reusability. The repository also includes a Visual Studio 2022 project configured to build the library as a Dynamic-Link Library (DLL).


-  [WIN32SDK-Client-Server-](https://github.com/Rishikesh103/WIN32SDK-Client-Server-) â€” A fundamental demonstration of how to create and use a Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) in C++ using Visual Studio. This project follows a simple "client-server" model where a "server" DLL provides a function that a "client" executable can use. This example focuses on exporting a single function


-  [OpenCV-Realtime-Recognization](https://github.com/Rishikesh103/OpenCV-Realtime-Recognization) â€” This is a Python-based application that uses computer vision to perform real-time face recognition from a webcam feed. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with **Tkinter** for easy interaction. The system allows for the registration of new users, classifying them as either "Criminal" or "Hostage,"


-  [Custom DBMS in Java](https://github.com/Rishikesh103/Custom-DBMS) â€” A simple, command-line-based Database Management System (DBMS) written in pure Java. This project demonstrates core database functionalities like Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) using an in-memory LinkedList to store records. It also features a robust serialization-based backup and restore system.
